**We become defensive when criticised,and apply negative stereotypes to others to boost our esteem.**

Q：

How do you normally **handle criticism**？

A： 

**1: Listen.**
Actually hear what’s being said. If necessary, ask questions to make sure you **understand** the criticism **fully**.

**2: Assume good intentions**
Unless proven otherwise, assume good intentions. Don’t automatically **jump to the conclusion** that the person criticising you is “out to get you.” Of course, sometimes they are. If so, see below.

**3: Do not get defensive and start making excuses.**
Instead you might say what you’ve learned and what you will do differently **from now on**.

**4: Don’t take it personally**
Remember that they’re criticizing your work, not you as a person. Never take negative feedback about your work as a criticism of you as a person.

**5: See criticism as help**
Remember that all **constructive feedback** (including negative feedback) is a sign of interest and a sign that people want to help you do better. It would be far worse for people to notice you doing bad work and not **say a word**.

**6: Don’t be too hard on yourself**
Remember that everyone makes mistakes and has things to learn. Yes, that includes you. There’s nothing wrong with making mistakes, but making the same mistakes **over and over** because you refuse to listen to criticism and learn is just stupid.

**7: Say thank you**
Thank the person for their feedback.



Q： 

How do you regulate your mood when criticised?

Thus,exercise may **regulate mood** and help people **cope with** the challenges of life.
